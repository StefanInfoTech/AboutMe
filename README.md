# AboutMe

### My name is Stefan Tomovski and I've created this page to tell you a bit about me.

#### Personal Life

I moved to Columbia, MO my sophmore year of highschool and attended Rockbridge Highschool. I played lacrosse my sophomore and junior year. I applied to Mizzou and got accepted my senior year. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do so I took my dads suggestion to try out Information Technology. So far ive enjoyed the abstract concepts and plan to stick with the major.

#### Interests

My freetime is spent:
* Playing Video Games
* Golfing
* Running
* Lifting
* Going for walks

#### Video Games

Since the pandemic has been going on since March most of my freetime has been spent playing video games
